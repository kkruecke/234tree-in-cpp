Work on remove() bug. See "TODO:" in remove(K key, Node234 *current).

----------------
Convert code to use managed pointers:


unique_ptr objects automatically delete the object they manage (using a deleter) as soon as they themselves are destroyed,
or as soon as their value changes either by an assignment operation or by an explicit call to unique_ptr::reset.
