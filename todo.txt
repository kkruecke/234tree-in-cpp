Change code so that it does not return values using reference parameters anywhere. To this end...:

1. RVO
2. Undeerstand std::tuple
3. std::move()

I will need to redesign DoSearch() and all methods that used DoSearch(). DoSearch() is called by the class iterator. Re-examine the iterator class? Can I make it simplier?
DoSearch() is only called by getRemoveSuccessor(). They don't seem a whole lot different. They both, however, use reference paramaters to return values. I want to eliminate this and use either a pair, a struct or a tuple to 
return the value using RVO.
