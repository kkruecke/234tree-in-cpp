The deletion code looks messy and confused, especially looking for the inorder successor.
Consider a tree iterator class to use in the implementation, and use it, say, for searching for a hit, etc.

class iterator {

    Node234* current;
 
   public:

     iterator(Node234 *root) : current{root} {}
     
     iterator operator++(int);
     iterator operator++();

};
