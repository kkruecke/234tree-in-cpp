TODOES/Thoughts
===============

1. Do I need to add or delete move ctor and move assignment to Node234 class? No, the don't handle any resources. 
2. Try to remove the use of raw Node234 pointers as much as possible.

2. The code for

 template<typename K> bool Tree234<K>::remove(K key, Node234 *current)

code looks messy and confused, especially looking for the inorder successor. It relies on a check_if_key_moved flag to track whether the index of the in-order
successor has moved due to side effects of calling other member functions. This makes the code awfully messy. And it uses a prospective_in_order successor pointer
in a complex loop, again making it hard to read.


3. Should I consider a tree descend_iterator class to use in the implementation, and use it, say, for searching for a hit, etc?

 Usage:

DesentSearchIterator finder(root);

do { 

  if (finder->found())
         break; 
      
} while (finder->next() != nullptr && !finder->eof());

Any need for it?
