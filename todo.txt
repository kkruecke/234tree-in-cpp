The deletion code looks messy and confused, especially looking for the inorder successor.
Consider a tree descend_iterator class to use in the implementation, and use it, say, for searching for a hit, etc?

See key-descent-iterator.h


KeyDesentFinder finder(root);

do { 

  if (finder->found())
         break; 
      
} while (finder->next() && !finder->eof());
