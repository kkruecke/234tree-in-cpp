TODO
====

Not all the iterator methods have been ported from class tree23. Those like getLeafNodePredecessor and getLeafNodeSuccessor will require an extra case statement within the switch statement, and the logic will need to be double check to ensure
it is appropriate for 2 3 4 trees predecessor and successor. And, of course, it will then need to be tested, as do the tree23 iterator methods.

insert
------

Tailor the insert test cases in main.cpp so that when insert calls split (to split a 3-node), when test both when the parent is a 2-node and a 3-node, and we ensure that when split inserts the middle value (of the 3-node) into the parent,
the value will be inserted in every possible position in the parent--before the first key, after the first, or (in the case of 3-nodes) before the second key or after it.

remove
------

remove()'s output needs to be examined to confirm that it is a valid 2-3-4 tree, after an element is removed.
