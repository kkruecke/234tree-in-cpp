The reverse_iterator classes have a bug. They simply use the STL revese_iterator adaptor. The problem seems to be in the iterator copy ctor, perhaps. It reinvokes initialize() rather than simply copying member variables.

insert
------

Tailor the insert test cases in main.cpp so that when insert calls split (to split a 3-node), when test both when the parent is a 2-node and a 3-node, and we ensure that when split inserts the middle value (of the 3-node) into the parent,
the value will be inserted in every possible position in the parent--before the first key, after the first, or (in the case of 3-nodes) before the second key or after it.

remove
------

remove()'s output needs to be examined to confirm that it is a valid 2-3-4 tree, after an element is removed.
