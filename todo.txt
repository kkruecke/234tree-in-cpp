insert() seems to work. But to simplify some of its code, consider...merging the insertChild(int insert_index, uniqye_ptr<Node234>& newChild) into the Node234::insert(KeyValye&&, unique_ptr<Node234>largestNode) code,
so it is more understandable as one unit, since insertChild() is only called by insert(KeyValue&&, unique_ptr<Node234>& larger).

remove() needs to be tested more. Confirm that the output from the tree is a valid 2 3 4 tree.
