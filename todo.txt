Finish implementing code to use unique_ptr. Focus on what each routine does, the pseudo code, as this will tell
you what parameters each method will need to take, in the unique_ptr version of Tree234.

Doesn't connectChild always set an empty, unused array element?

Add noexcept to function signatures where no exceptions are thrown. Add constexpr where appropriate...and so on with
other C++11 constructs.
