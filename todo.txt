TODO
====

The latest ported code -- which has compile errors -- is in include/new-tree234.h

I started the port of iterator class and method from tree23. Much of it is done; however, the iterator::increment() and iterator::decrement() from tree23 have not been ported to class 2 3 4. Also, there are bugs with the iterator class due 
to exeception specifications being incorrect--because some of the the tree234::iterator methods throw exceptions.

insert
------

Tailor the insert test cases in main.cpp so that when insert calls split (to split a 3-node), when test both when the parent is a 2-node and a 3-node, and we ensure that when split inserts the middle value (of the 3-node) into the parent,
the value will be inserted in every possible position in the parent--before the first key, after the first, or (in the case of 3-nodes) before the second key or after it.

remove
------

remove()'s output needs to be examined to confirm that it is a valid 2-3-4 tree, after an element is removed.
