Change code so that it does not return values using reference parameters anywhere in code. Methods affected:

1. SearchNode(Key key, int index& index);
2. DoSearch(.....)
3. getRemoveSuccessor(...) which calls DoSearch()

I will need to redesign DoSearch() and all methods that used DoSearch(). DoSearch() is called by the class iterator. Re-examine the iterator class? Can I make it simplier?
DoSearch() is only called by getRemoveSuccessor(). They don't seem a whole lot different. They both, however, use reference paramaters to return values. I want to eliminate this and use either a pair, a struct or a tuple to 
return the value using RVO.

Start with the TODO in code. This will require understanding what the code is doing by drawing illustrations, relearning what it is doing, etc.
