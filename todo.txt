1. Tree234<K>::size() does not seem to be working correctly.

2. On pfound_node becoming invalid after conrtTwodNoe is called. 
   The node is always searched, in remove(K key, Node234 *) after first bneing converted from a 2-node except in one case: where the root is a 2-node and has two 2-node children.
   Then pfoundd_node -- if it is one of the 2-node children of the rootwill be deleted after fuseWithChjildren() is called.
   
   I'm not sure what would happen when fuseSiblings gets called, whether pfoudn_node might become invalid. When either left- or roghtRotation() is called for a 
   child node of pfoudn_node, may move the key; however, pfoudn_node is still valid--right--as the rotation might delte the silobing that is robbed, but only it.


prospective code to handle the above situation might be to pass another parameter to convertTwoNode:

  convertTwoNode(...., Node234 *&pfound_node_ref)

1.  http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~liorma/cpsc320/files/B-trees.pdf

This link has an excellent working example. The explanation is thorough and clear. It gives several example of deleting elements. It uses the in-order predecessor
rather than the successor when deleting.

2.  www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/~viren/Courses/2009/SE286/2-3Trees-Mod.ppt  

This link has a excellent working example and discusses how delete works, using descent restructuring. It uses the swap-with-successor for deletion of internal keys.
It contains a working tree example. It shows that when converting 2-nodes, we first check if we can rotation else we do a merge (since both siblings are 2-nodes).

3.  http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krueger/cscB63h/lectures/tut04.txt 

This link has excellent pseudo code for both insertion and deletion with working example. But it does not restructure the key on the way down instead from the
leaf upward.

4. http://web.njit.edu/~wl256/download/cs610/n1561011.pdf

This link has a more high level pseudo code. 

5. http://www2.thu.edu.tw/~emtools/Adv.%20Data%20Structure/2-3,2-3-4%26red-blackTree_952.pdf 

This link discusses both 2 3 trees and 2 3 4 trees. It has examples and pseudo code, but the deletion logic points out that the root only can be a two node--I think?

This link has actual **Java implementation code** for insertion and for 2 3 4 tree interface and node interface, including members.
