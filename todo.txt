1. Do I need to add or delete move ctor and move assignment to Node234 class? Some question for copy ctor and copy assignment.

2. The code for

 template<typename K> bool Tree234<K>::remove(K key, Node234 *current)

code looks messy and confused, especially looking for the inorder successor.
Consider a tree descend_iterator class to use in the implementation, and use it, say, for searching for a hit, etc?


3. See key-descent-iterator.h. Usage:

DesentSearchIterator finder(root);

do { 

  if (finder->found())
         break; 
      
} while (finder->next() != nullptr && !finder->eof());

Any need for it?
