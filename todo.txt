TODO
----

Add the code change to new-tree234.h so that the methods work like those of **class tree23**.
Bug
--

Is the remove() code is working correctly? It ultimately does root.reset(), which sets the underlying pointer to nullptr. However, when the destructor calls
DestroyTree(root), the root is inexplicably no longer nullptr and totalItems is 1.



Another issue
-------------

1. Tree234<K>::size() does not seem to be working correctly.

Debug Printing
--------------

Port the debug_printer used for tree23 so that it works for tree234.
