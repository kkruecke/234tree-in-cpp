The latest tree234-new.h port is not inserting properly. Why?

To properly debug, add to special treexxx::test_invariant() method does does what levelOrderTraverse() does, but also builds (or uses) a stack of descent indecies (or parent pointer values), so that the parent pointer of each Nodexxx can be properly tested, ie,
the parent would be at the top of the stack? Perhaps this method should not use recursion but instead use iteration and imploy a local stack.....OR, instead of a stack maybe a getSuccessor() method could be implemented for the the 2-3-4 tree. This
would eliminate the need for a stack.

The levelOrderInvariantReport class would, then, no longer be needed.

Compare debug sessions of old code that works with new code that fails.
