1. First get rid of current compile errors. 
2. Then change code so that it does not return values using reference parameters anywhere in code. 
3. Fix apparent bugs in getRemoveSuccessor. The getRemoveSuccessor() code at the top for the leaf node case looks wrong. I call DoSearch--but simply search for the key again--huh, how can that be right? Compare the getRemoveSuccessor() code, which must also convert 2-nodes, as it searches for the in-order successor, to 3- or 4-nodes, to
iterator::getSuccessor(), which calls either getLeafNodeSuccessor() or getInternalNodeSuccessor(), neither of which call any other methods. 

Get rid of returning values in reference paramaters. Use either a pair, a struct or a tuple to return the value using RVO.
